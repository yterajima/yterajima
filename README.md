### Hi there, I'm [yuya-matsushima](https://github.com/yuya-matsushima) (ex. `yterajima`)! :wave:

Hi, I'm Yuya Matsushima, Web Developer from Japan.

- :office: I'm currently working on [fillin Inc.](https://www.fillin-inc.com)
    - I work mainly with Ruby, JavaScript and Go.
    - I also work with PHP occasionally.
- :book: I'm currently studying to Async Processing in Go, AWS and Company Management.

### NOTICE: In August 23, 2021, My account name was changed :couple:

```diff
- https://github.com/yterajima
+ https://github.com/yuya-matsushima
```

Reason for change :

When I got married :couple: in September 2016, my last name changed from `Terajima` to `Matsushima`.

I changed it to `yuya-matsushima` because my account was different from my actual name and it often interfered with my work.
